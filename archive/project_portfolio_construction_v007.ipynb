    "\n",
    "The initial formulation of the Black-Litterman model for Portfolio construction was described in the 1992 paper. The paper described an intuitive solution by combining the mean-variance opitimisation framework of Markowitz and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe and Lintner. The model uses equilibrium risk premiums to provide a neutral reference point for expected returns, generating a market-capitalisation-weighted-portfolio and then incorporating subjective views that tilts in the direction of assets favored by the investor to enable the generation of alpha. The Black-Litterman models assumes does not assume the model is always at CAPM equilibrium, but any shift away from this equilibrium will experience pressure from the market to revert. Furthermore, the model allows the investor to have as many, or as few, views as they wish on either an absolute or relative basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with the CAPM model and minimum-variance portfolio decribed by Markowitz is that small tweaks in the values could lead to significant rebalancing of the portfolio. The Markowitz framework effectively takes the risk-free return as the alternative benchmark. \n",

    "There functional x numbers of steps we need to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need to asign weights to our portfolio based on a relevant benchmark or methodology. \n",
    "- We need to construct prior returns for each of our assets based on their relative weights\n",
    "- We need to construct a matrix of investor views to cause our assets to diverge from the initial weights \n",
    "- We combine the market implied returns and investor views to get the posterior distribution\n",
    "- We then generate our new allocations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a 60/40 US portfolio as our benchmark we will use the reference ETFs SPY to proxy the equitiy portion of the portfolio and the fixed income portion will be represented via AGG. We will use 11 ETFs to represent the GICS sectors and we will weight these assets according to the market weights of the SPY reference index, and we will break down the fixed income allocation into short and long dated sectors with the appropriate weights according to AGG benchmark.\n",

    "\n",
    "Naturally if we plug these implied returns back into our formula for the optimal weights we will arrive back at the market weights we initially used to derive the returns. The Black-Litterman model only suggests a deviation from the market returns once we have formulated views on assets. We need to specify our views on the market, which may or may not, clash with the reference market distribution. \n",

    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that we have an absolute view and a relative view, this does not necessarily suggest that we should positively allocate to the asset that we expect to either return positively or outperform the other asset. We need to compare our prediction against the implied return from the existing market weights and determine whether our view is producing either a positive or negative deviation from the implied market return, and only in the event of a positive deviation would we then increase our potential allocation. In the case of our first view we have an implied excess return for Energy at 7.45%, and therefore an excess return of 2% would represent a decrease of 45bps. We should see a reduction in the market allocation to this sector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly although we are predicting an outperform of Information Technology over Financials we need to evaluate what the existing out-or-underperformance between the two sectors. Once again we can see that the Information Technology sector currently outperforms Financials by 81bps. The prediction of 25bps would represent another negative bias towards Information Technolgoy and should see an increase in the allocation to Financials correspondingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation is more complicated when we evaluate multiple sectors against each other because of the interlinking allocation dynamics. We will need to form two mini portfolios with each sector given proportional weighting to it's market weights and then compare the performance of two portfolios to determine whether our relative prediction will generate a positive or negative bias towards the existing allocation.
