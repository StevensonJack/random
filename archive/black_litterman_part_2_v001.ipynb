    "#### 1.4 What is the Black-Litterman Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial formulation of the Black-Litterman model for Portfolio construction was described in the 1992 paper. The paper described an intuitive solution by combining the mean-variance opitimisation framework of Markowitz and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe and Lintner. The issue with the CAPM model and minimum-variance portfolio decribed by Markowitz is that small tweaks in the values could lead to significant rebalancing of the portfolio. The Markowitz framework effectively takes the risk-free return as the alternative benchmark. The Black-Litterman model on the otherhand uses equilibrium risk premiums to provide a neutral reference point for expected returns, generating a market-capitalisation-weighted-portfolio and then incorporating subjective views that tilts in the direction of assets favored by the investor to enable the generation of alpha. The Black-Litterman models assumes does not assume the model is always at CAPM equilibrium, but any shift away from this equilibrium will experience pressure from the market to revert. Furthermore, the model allows the investor to have as many, or as few, views as they wish on either an absolute or relative basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will undertake the following steps in the next few sections to construct our portfolio according to the Black-Litterman framework. Firstly, we need to assign our portfolio weights based upon the market capitalisation of our benchmark portfolio. As previously outlined we will assign 92% of our portfolio to the S&P 500 sectors that we have proxied via iShares ETFs and will according allocate based on their weight in the S&P 500 in 2022. The remaining 8% of the portfolio will be equally split across our three exogenous factors, four Fama-French factors and custom momentum factor. Based on these weights we will derive the implied market returns for each of our factors. Due to this method of deriving the market implied returns the frame work does not recommend deviating from the market returns until you formulate views about the factor that cause them to deviate on either an absolute or relative basis from the implied returns. Once we have formulated our views on the market then we will combine our market implied returns and views via Bayes Theorem to construct a posterior returns distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use our posterior returns distribution to calculate our views adjusted optimal weights for our portfolio. Finally, once we have completed this optimisation we will compare how our new portfolio performs vs the benchmark S&P from 2022 to 2024. "

We need to specify our forward looking views on the market, which may or may not, clash with the reference market distribution. \n",

We need to compare our prediction against the implied return from the existing market weights and determine whether our view is producing either a positive or negative deviation from the implied market return, and only in the event of a positive deviation would we then increase our potential allocation. In the case of our first view we have an implied excess return for Energy at 6.77%, and therefore an excess return of 6.50% would represent a decrease of 27bps. We should expect to see a reduction in the market allocation to this sector. \n",
